If you want, you can set up cfg.json file. You can set login, password and what to backup in this file. (e.g. if you want to make auto backups with this script) \n
\n
Example of cfg.json\n
```json
{
    "login": "myTidalLogin",
    "password": "myPassword",
    "backup": "all"
}
```
\nIf you don't provide something, you'll be asked for it.
\n"backup" can be set to: all or UUID of playlist
